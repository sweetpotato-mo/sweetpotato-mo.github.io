# Implementation Report

## Individual Contributions

The following table summarizes the actual contributions of each group member, including deviations from the planned responsibilities. 
The "implemented components" column should only include major contributions to the respective components (i.e., no bugfixes or small additions to existing components).

| Member     | Implemented Components | Testing Contributions | Additional Work |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Alice      | [Describe implemented components here] | [Describe testing contributions here] | [Describe additional work here] |
| Bob        | [Describe implemented components here] | [Describe testing contributions here] | [Describe additional work here] |
| ...        | ...                    | ...                   | ...             |

## Detailed Timeline 

For each student, this section should provide a detailed day-by-day timeline of their activities and progress.

### Alice

- **Day 1:**

## Usage of Generative AI

Choose the correct option that applies to each individual student (if you diverted from your initial statement in the implementation plan, make sure to explicitely state it here):

**Alice:**
*Option 1:*
We did not use generative AI in the implementation phase (neither for code-completion, rewriting code, nor testing).

*Option 2:*
(insert tool names properly; if applicable add links or add version numbers of the used tools)
Alice used the following tools in the implementation phase:
Tool-1 for code completion and tool Tool-2 for ... . In addition, she used Tool-3 for ...

**Bob:**
...

In case of option 2, add additional sentences in which you provide more details on which tools you used for which specific tasks and to which extent.

We are aware of the potential dangers of using these tools and take full responsibility for any code, documents and other content produced during the group phase.
